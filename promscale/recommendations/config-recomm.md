# Configuration recommendations

This section describes the configuration recommendations for Promscale.

## Database configuration

You can use the `timescaledb-tune` tool to set most common parameters to the best
values for your system. The tool accounts for memory, CPU, and PostgreSQL version. For
more information, see [configuration][timescale-tune-configuration]. Additionally,
there are a few other PostgreSQL parameters that you might like to adjust:

*   `checkpoint_timeout=15min` - when a lot of data is ingested, increase the
  checkpoint timeout to reduce the input/output pressure.
*   `max_wal_size` - set it to a high enough value so that the checkpoint is triggered
  by the timeout setting, much before the `max_wal_size` is reached.
*   `synchronous_commit=off` - this does not cause data corruption or
  inconsistency. However, in case of a crash, some of the most recent data points could be
  lost. For a monitoring observability use case, it's a reasonable trade-off to
  increase ingest performance.
* `shared_buffers` - set it to at least 50% of available memory, we tried to estimate it for metrics ingestion,  see [Promscale Resource recommendations guide][promscale-resource-recommendations].

Make sure that the maximum latency between the
Promscale connector and the database is no more than 100&nbsp;ms.
